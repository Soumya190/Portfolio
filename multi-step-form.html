                    <p>I have developed a sophisticated multi-step form using React.js, leveraging my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a seamless and user-friendly experience. This form guides users through a series of steps, ensuring a smooth and intuitive process. Key features include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Utilized React's component-based architecture to build a dynamic and interactive form.</li>
                        <li>Implemented custom validation logic to ensure data accuracy at each step.</li>
                        <li>Real-time validation and error handling to provide immediate feedback to users.</li>
                        <li>Managed form state efficiently, allowing users to navigate between steps without losing data.</li>
