                    <p>I've recently developed a news portal app that offers a seamless way to stay updated with the latest news where users can easily browse news articles by various categories such as sports, technology, health , entertainment, and more. A powerful search bar allows users to find specific news articles based on their interests or keywords. The app includes a pagination bar, enabling users to navigate through different pages of articles effortlessly. The app utilizes the News API to fetch up-to-date news data, ensuring that users always have access to the latest information.
